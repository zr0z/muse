muse
====

**muse** is a stupid command line mp3 player for osx. It is built in Objective-C on top of the `AVFoundation` framework. 
The only external library required is `ncurses` that comes bundled with OSX.

**muse** is released under the MIT license.

Since version 0.3, **muse** is a bit smarter and you can read multiple mp3 files using a wildcard (such as `*.mp3`) on the command line or passing several files as arguments.

Since version 0.4, **muse** accepts `wads` commands:

- `w` will quit muse,
- `a` will play the previous song,
- `s` will toggle between play and pause,
- `d` will play the next song.

Installation
------------

You will need OSX 10.7+ and the latest XCode command line tools (with LLVM 4.0+ as I rely on automatic synthesize for the properties).

### One-line install

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/zr0z/muse/master/muse-install.sh | sh

### Building from git

Grab a copy of the source code:

	git clone https://github.com/zr0z/muse.git

Build and install it:

	make && make install

**muse** will be installed in your `/usr/local/bin`.  
Depending on your permissions, you may have to use `sudo make install` to finalize the installation.

Usage

	usage: muse [-h|--help] <music files>
