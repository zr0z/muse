muse
====

**muse** is a stupid command line mp3 player for osx. It is built in Objective-C on top of the `AVFoundation` framework and doesn't require any external libraries.

**muse** is released under the MIT license.

Since version 0.3, **muse** is a bit smarter and you can read multiple mp3 files using a wildcard (such as `*.mp3`) on the command line or passing several files as arguments.

If you want to quit **muse** during play `Ctrl-C` is your best friend.
