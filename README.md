muse
====

**muse** is a stupid command line mp3 player for osx. It is built in Objective-C on top of the `AVFoundation` framework and doesn't require any external libraries.

**muse** is released under the MIT license.

Currently, it is too dumb to read more than one file at a time, but you can read a whole directory by doing a loop on all the mp3 files:

	$ for tune in *.mp3; do muse $tune; done;

If you want to quit **muse** during play `Ctrl-C` is your best friend.
